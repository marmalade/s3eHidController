This extension allows you to read input such as DPad, A/B/X/Y buttons and analog stick values from an Xbox-360 or compatible game-pad on PC. 
You can also use it with a PS3 Six-Axis controller connected via USB or a Bluetooth dongle. Note that for PS3 Six-Axis controllers to work, 
you will require a 3rd-party driver such as MotionJoy whereas the 360 controller is natively supported by Windows
